    "There are two reasons. The first (and not so important) reason is that qTable.qtable is initialized to be all zeros. As a result, the agent would always take one action and cannot update its qtable as it can never reach the goal grid. To deal with the problem, you can initialize the qTable.qtable with random numbers. If you are lucky enough, you may get some successful episodes. But try to rerun the cell for multiple times, you will find that the agent still cannot reach the goal grid for most episode.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second (and important) reason is that at the beginning of the training process, the *qtable* is extremely noisy. If we rely on it to make decision for each step, then it is very likely that we cannot reach the goal position. Moreover, as we cannot get the reward, the *bellman_equation* cannot effectively update the *qtable*, and we may end up with no succesful episode.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly the reason we employ $\\epsilon$-greedy strategy for the training process. Recall that $\\epsilon$-greedy strategy means that the agent, in every state, takes random actions with a $\\epsilon$ probability while takes the optimal action with a $1-\\epsilon$ probability. Actually, this is often called **exploration** in reinforcement learning. At the beginning of the training process, the agent should explore the environment (maybe aggressively) to discover actions that lead to high rewards: this is a key component of reinforcement learning. In this case, the $\\epsilon$ should be large. After some training iterations, the agent should be more clever to take good actions, and thus we can take a smaller $\\epsilon$ to decrease the exploration. This is often called **exploitation** in reinforcement learning, as we try to exploit the existing policy/qtable. The exploration and exploitation trade-off is often a key trade-off in reinforcement learning. Briefly speaking, in the beginning of training, the agent should focus more on the exploration to train a good policy; as training goes by, the agent should pay more and more attention on exploitability. In practice, we often use a exponential decay strategy to decay the exploration probability.\n",

    "Note that this is continous task. For this game there are a huge number of states available. The state has four values: the position and velocity of the cart, and the position and velocity of the pole. These are all real-valued numbers, so ignoring floating point precisions, you practically have infinite states. Though we can somehow discretize the state and apply the *qtable* approach, we'll replace it with a approximator that will approximate the *qtable* lookup function. Thus we can no longer apply the *qtable* for this task. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, our Q value, $Q(s, a)$ is calculated by passing in a state to the approximator. The output will be Q values for each available action.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define our targets for training as $\\hat{Q}(s,a) = r + \\gamma \\max{Q(s', a')}$. Then we update the weights by minimizing $(\\hat{Q}(s,a) - Q(s,a))^2$, which is exactly a regression problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this Cart-Pole game, we have four inputs, one for each value in the state, and two outputs, one for each action. To get $\\hat{Q}$, we'll first choose an action, then simulate the game using that action. This will get us the next state, $s'$, and the reward. With that, we can calculate $\\hat{Q}$ then pass it back into the $Q$ approximator to run the optimizer and update the weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that since this is a regression task, we can use any regressor we have learned before. At first, we will try to use linear regression for this task. Feel free to use TensorFlow or Pytorch or even the code you have written in previous homework. \n",
    "\n",
    "FYI: GPU should provide more efficient training for these models, though a modern CPU should be enough for this homework. Our laptop (i5) can finish all the training tasks in dozens of minutes.\n",

    "\n",
    "Disappointedly, you may find that the approximator still struggle to converge and get good results. There are several potential reasons for this phenomenon. One reason is that the *new_state* is generated from current *state*, which violates the i.i.d assumption in supervised learning. And this may easily lead to bad convergence performance. One popular strategy for improving the convergence rate and making data more i.i.d is **experience replay**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, when using **experience replay**, we would like to keep a memory pool filled with the experience the agent had before. More specifically, we would save the *(state, action, reward, new_state, done)* tuple in a memory pool, which denotes the previous experience. For each step of training, we sample a batch of experiences from the memory pool, and train the approximator with this batch. This can be seen as replaying a batch of previous experiences. Also, we would generate a new experience according to the current state and the approximator, and add this new experience to the memory pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in this case, the experience an agent has can be used to train the approximator multiple times. In some real-world applications, the experience may be very expensive to gain, and thus experience replay enables a more efficient use of previous experience. Also, as approximator is trained with a batch, the SGD optimizer typically converges more fast.\n",

    "### TODO: implement experience replay in your Approximator class\n",

    "## (Optional) Double Q-Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "As we only use the same model to both determine the greedy policy and to determine its value, sometimes the model may learn unrealistically high action values because it includes a maximization step over estimated action values, which tends to prefer over-estimated to underestimated values. Imagine that the model learns an over-estimated value for one action, then this action is very more likely to be selected. Further, as the values are estimated with the same model, the updated value for this action is still over-estimated, which makes the other actions difficult to be explored and updated. As a result, the convergence may be slowed down, and even the performance of the final model may be harmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen, the over-estimated problem is partly caused by using the same model to determine the policy and value. Then how can we address this problem? A natural idea is to decouple these two steps by using two different models to determine the policy and value respectively. This is called **double Q-learning**. We call the model that determine the policy as Policy Model and the model that determine the value as Value Model. To avoid introduce an additional network, a very smart trick is like this: when training the models with one episode, we freeze the Value Model and update only the Policy Model. After one episode is trained, we update the Value Model with the weights of the Policy Model. Alternatively, we can update the Value Model with the weights of Policy Model periodically (say, 500 iterations). Although the Policy Model and the Value Model are not fully decoupled in this way, this approach is simple to implement and avoid further network designs. As you will see, this works well in practice.\n",

    "Congratulations! You have finished the journey of reinforcement learning here. There are also some other environments available in *gym* for you to play with. Equipped with the techniques you have learned so far, just feel free to play with them if interested.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, you have learned many practical techniques for reinforcement learning. Theortically, you can even build some famous systems such as AlphaGo mainly based on these techniques :) In AlphaGo, Atari, and many other real-world applications, the agents need to deal with the image/video input. Thus it is naturally to use CNNs as approximators. There are also some other techniques used in these systems, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search in AlphaGo, but the big pictures are similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply reinforcement learning in real-world problems, there are many other difficulties. I think the biggest challenge may be how to formulate your problems. What are the states? What are the rewards? Are they reasonable enough? How to gain experience? Unlike the environment in this notebook, in real world, these problems are often undefined. You need to formulate them yourself. Another challenge may be that the hyperparameters tuning would be quite difficult, even more difficult than CNNs/RNNs for some typical supervised/unsupervised learning problems. It requires some experience and practice :)\n",
